This is a project that I decided to work on. It is far from finished, 
but eventually you will be able to play monopoly from your command line.

Pull all files down and type:

make clean;make all 

in the command line while in the monopoly directory. 

To execute the monopoly game:

./monopoly

Have fun!

If you would like to help me out, fork and then submit a merge request!
